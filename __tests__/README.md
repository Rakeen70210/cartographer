## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run core functionality tests (recommended first)
npm run test:core

# Run all comprehensive tests
npm run test:comprehensive
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run specific test categories
npm run test:integration
npm run test:performance
npm run test:error-scenarios
npm run test:memory
npm run test:regression
```

### Standard Jest Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Configuration

### Performance Thresholds
The tests include configurable performance thresholds defined in `__tests__/utils/performance-monitor.js`:

```javascript
const PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  GEOMETRY_VALIDATION: {
    SIMPLE: 10,      // ms
    COMPLEX: 50,     // ms
    VERY_COMPLEX: 200 // ms
  },
  GEOMETRY_OPERATIONS: {
    BUFFER_CREATION: 100,    // ms
    UNION_SIMPLE: 200,       // ms
    UNION_COMPLEX: 1000,     // ms
    DIFFERENCE_SIMPLE: 150,  // ms
    DIFFERENCE_COMPLEX: 800  // ms
  },
  FOG_CALCULATION: {
    VIEWPORT_SIMPLE: 300,    // ms
    VIEWPORT_COMPLEX: 1500,  // ms
    WORLD_FOG: 50           // ms
  }
};
```

### Memory Thresholds
Memory usage thresholds are defined to catch memory leaks:
- Maximum memory increase: 100MB during operations
- Maximum memory leak: 20MB after cleanup

## Test Data

### Mock Data Factories
The test suite includes comprehensive mock data factories in `__tests__/setup/testSetup.js`:
- **Standard Test Data**: Empty, small, medium, and large datasets
- **Error Scenarios**: Network errors, database errors, validation errors
- **Geometry Test Cases**: Valid and invalid geometry examples
- **Network Scenarios**: Online, offline, poor connection states

### Test Constants
Standardized test constants ensure consistency:
```javascript
const TEST_CONSTANTS = {
  DEFAULT_LATITUDE: 37.7749,
  DEFAULT_LONGITUDE: -122.4194,
  DEFAULT_TIMESTAMP: 1640995200000,
  // ... more constants
};
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Performance Monitor Class
The `PerformanceMonitor` class provides consistent performance measurement:
```javascript
const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor('operation-name');
monitor.start();
// ... perform operation
const measurement = monitor.stop();
```

### Memory Monitoring
Memory monitoring utilities track memory usage during operations:
```javascript
const { result, memoryProfile } = await memoryMonitor.monitorOperation(async () => {
  // ... perform memory-intensive operation
});
```

## Error Handling Testing

### Fallback Strategy Testing
Tests validate that fallback strategies work correctly:
- **Viewport Fallback**: Falls back to viewport fog when world fog fails
- **World Fallback**: Falls back to world fog when viewport fog fails
- **Geometry Fallback**: Uses original geometry when operations fail

### Error Recovery Testing
Tests ensure components recover gracefully from errors:
- Database connection recovery
- Network error recovery
- Invalid data handling
- Resource cleanup after errors

## Continuous Integration

### Test Reports
The comprehensive test runner generates detailed reports:
- Execution time for each test suite
- Performance metrics and comparisons
- Memory usage analysis
- Error scenario coverage

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for refactored components
- 100% coverage for critical error handling paths
- Performance regression detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout in Jest configuration if needed
2. **Memory Issues**: Run tests with `--maxWorkers=1` for memory tests
3. **Performance Variance**: Allow for system performance variance in thresholds

### Debug Mode
Run tests with debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG_TESTS=true npm run test:comprehensive
```

### Performance Analysis
For detailed performance analysis:
```bash
npm run test:performance -- --verbose
```
