# Requirements Document

## Introduction

After the map-component-refactor changes, the test suite is experiencing 128 test failures across multiple test files. The failures are primarily related to logger import issues, behavioral inconsistencies in geometry operations, and hook state management problems. This feature will systematically identify and fix all test failures to restore the test suite to a passing state while maintaining the refactored code structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass after the map-component-refactor changes, so that I can confidently deploy and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN all tests SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN no logger-related errors SHALL occur
3. WHEN geometry operations are tested THEN they SHALL behave consistently with expected behaviors
4. WHEN hook state management is tested THEN loading states SHALL be properly managed
5. WHEN component lifecycle tests run THEN memory management SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want logger functionality to work correctly in all test environments, so that debugging and error tracking work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logger is imported in any module THEN it SHALL be properly initialized and available
2. WHEN logger methods (debug, error, warn) are called THEN they SHALL execute without throwing errors
3. WHEN tests mock logger functionality THEN the mocks SHALL be properly configured
4. WHEN logger is used in utility functions THEN it SHALL not cause undefined property errors
5. WHEN logger is used in hooks THEN it SHALL be available throughout the hook lifecycle

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want geometry operations to maintain consistent behavior after refactoring, so that fog calculations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN geometry validation is performed THEN it SHALL correctly identify valid and invalid geometries
2. WHEN geometry operations (union, difference, sanitization) are executed THEN they SHALL return expected results
3. WHEN geometry operations fail THEN they SHALL provide appropriate fallback strategies
4. WHEN complex geometries are processed THEN performance SHALL remain within acceptable bounds
5. WHEN geometry operations are tested THEN they SHALL match reference behavioral patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hook state management to work correctly after refactoring, so that UI components receive proper state updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hooks are initialized THEN loading states SHALL be properly set and managed
2. WHEN hooks perform async operations THEN loading states SHALL transition correctly
3. WHEN hooks encounter errors THEN error states SHALL be properly handled and exposed
4. WHEN hooks are unmounted THEN cleanup SHALL occur without memory leaks
5. WHEN hooks are tested THEN they SHALL provide consistent state transitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component lifecycle and memory management to work correctly, so that the application remains performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are mounted and unmounted THEN memory SHALL be properly managed
2. WHEN hooks are used in components THEN they SHALL not cause memory leaks
3. WHEN test renderers are used THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN component integration tests run THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN it SHALL remain within acceptable bounds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test mocks and setup to work correctly after refactoring, so that tests run in isolated environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test setup files are loaded THEN all required mocks SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN tests use mocked dependencies THEN the mocks SHALL behave as expected
3. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's mocks
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN all mocks SHALL be properly reset
5. WHEN test utilities are used THEN they SHALL provide consistent behavior across test files
