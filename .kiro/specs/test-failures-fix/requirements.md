# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cartographer application currently has 129 failing tests across multiple modules including statistics, geospatial calculations, network utilities, caching, and performance optimizations. These test failures indicate critical issues in core functionality that need to be systematically addressed to ensure application reliability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all statistics screen tests to pass, so that the statistics dashboard displays correctly and provides reliable user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the statistics screen is rendered THEN the component SHALL include a testID="statistics-screen" attribute
2. WHEN the statistics screen is in loading state THEN it SHALL display loading indicators for all statistics cards
3. WHEN the statistics screen handles undefined data THEN it SHALL gracefully display appropriate fallback content
4. WHEN the statistics screen handles null data THEN it SHALL not crash and display appropriate error states
5. WHEN the statistics screen component is unmounted during data loading THEN it SHALL not throw errors or cause memory leaks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want world exploration calculator validation to work correctly, so that geospatial calculations are accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating complex MultiPolygon geometries THEN the system SHALL correctly identify valid polygon structures
2. WHEN validating malformed coordinate structures THEN the system SHALL reject invalid geometries and return false
3. WHEN formatting exploration percentages THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases like very large percentages correctly
4. WHEN processing nested Feature objects THEN the system SHALL extract geometry data properly
5. WHEN handling insufficient coordinate data THEN the system SHALL reject polygons with less than required coordinates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want offline statistics functionality to work reliably, so that I can view my exploration data even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is online THEN the offline statistics hook SHALL fetch and return current statistics data
2. WHEN the app comes back online after being offline THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh statistics data
3. WHEN the app is offline with cached data THEN the system SHALL return cached statistics with offline indicators
4. WHEN calculating basic statistics offline THEN the system SHALL compute distance and exploration metrics from local data
5. WHEN cache data is expired THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and attempt to refresh when possible
6. WHEN forced offline mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL only use cached data regardless of connectivity
7. WHEN forced online mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL only fetch fresh data from network

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want network utilities to handle edge cases properly, so that connectivity detection and network operations are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connectivity tests timeout THEN the system SHALL return false indicating no connection
2. WHEN network state fetch encounters errors THEN the system SHALL return disconnected state with unknown connection type
3. WHEN determining offline status THEN the system SHALL correctly identify when the device is offline
4. WHEN assessing connection quality on poor networks THEN the system SHALL return "poor" quality rating
5. WHEN waiting for connection with timeout THEN the system SHALL return false if connection is not established within timeout period

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want distance calculations and formatting to be accurate, so that exploration metrics display correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting negative distances THEN the system SHALL display negative values with appropriate precision
2. WHEN formatting NaN or Infinity values THEN the system SHALL display readable representations like "NaN" and "Infinity"
3. WHEN calculating distances between coordinates THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases like identical points
4. WHEN converting between units THEN the system SHALL maintain precision and accuracy
5. WHEN handling invalid coordinate inputs THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error values or fallbacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to pass, so that the application maintains acceptable performance under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing tasks with different priorities THEN the system SHALL execute high priority tasks before low priority tasks
2. WHEN caching and retrieving values THEN the system SHALL store and return cached data efficiently
3. WHEN using getOrCompute functionality THEN the system SHALL only compute values once and cache results
4. WHEN handling large location datasets THEN calculations SHALL complete within 5 seconds
5. WHEN caching large datasets THEN operations SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
6. WHEN performing concurrent cache operations THEN all operations SHALL complete successfully without data corruption

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cache management to work reliably, so that application performance is optimized and data persistence is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data in cache THEN the system SHALL persist data with timestamps and metadata
2. WHEN retrieving cached data THEN the system SHALL return data in the expected format
3. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN cache reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate eviction strategies
5. WHEN concurrent cache access occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and prevent race conditions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want offline capabilities assessment to work correctly, so that the application can determine what features are available offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing offline capabilities with full data THEN the system SHALL correctly identify all available offline features
2. WHEN assessing offline capabilities with minimal data THEN the system SHALL accurately report limited functionality
3. WHEN determining distance calculation capability THEN the system SHALL check for required location data
4. WHEN determining world exploration capability THEN the system SHALL verify availability of geographic boundary data
5. WHEN determining regional calculation capability THEN the system SHALL validate presence of hierarchical geographic data
