# Design Document

## Overview

The test failures after the map-component-refactor are primarily caused by three main issues:
1. **Logger Import Issues**: The logger module is not properly initialized or imported in test environments
2. **Hook State Management**: Loading states in hooks are not transitioning correctly, causing tests to timeout
3. **Test Setup and Mocking**: Some test mocks and setup configurations are not properly aligned with the refactored code structure

This design addresses these issues systematically by fixing the logger configuration, correcting hook state management, and updating test setup files.

## Architecture

### Logger System Fix
The logger system needs to be properly initialized in test environments. The current failures show `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'debug')` errors, indicating the logger is not being imported or initialized correctly.

**Solution Approach:**
- Ensure logger module exports are properly structured
- Add proper logger initialization in test setup files
- Create logger mocks for test environments where needed
- Verify all logger imports use consistent import paths

### Hook State Management Correction
Multiple hooks are showing loading state issues where `isLoading` remains `true` indefinitely, causing test timeouts. This suggests async operations are not completing or state updates are not being triggered.

**Solution Approach:**
- Review hook initialization and state management logic
- Ensure async operations in hooks properly update loading states
- Add proper error handling that transitions loading states
- Verify hook cleanup and memory management

### Test Setup and Mocking Updates
Some test mocks and setup configurations need to be updated to work with the refactored code structure.

**Solution Approach:**
- Update test setup files to properly mock refactored modules
- Ensure test utilities work with new component and hook structure
- Fix component lifecycle test issues with test renderer cleanup
- Update mock configurations for geometry operations and database functions

## Components and Interfaces

### Logger Module Interface
```typescript
interface Logger {
  debug(message: string, ...args: any[]): void;
  info(message: string, ...args: any[]): void;
  warn(message: string, ...args: any[]): void;
  error(message: string, ...args: any[]): void;
}
```

### Hook State Interface
```typescript
interface HookState {
  isLoading: boolean;
  isCalculating?: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  // ... other state properties
}
```

### Test Setup Interface
```typescript
interface TestSetup {
  setupMocks(): void;
  cleanupMocks(): void;
  mockLogger(): Logger;
  mockDatabase(): DatabaseMock;
}
```

## Data Models

### Test Failure Categories
1. **Logger Failures**: 50+ failures related to undefined logger properties
2. **Hook State Failures**: 30+ failures related to loading state timeouts
3. **Component Lifecycle Failures**: 10+ failures related to test renderer cleanup
4. **Geometry Operation Failures**: 20+ failures related to behavioral consistency
5. **Mock Configuration Failures**: 8+ failures related to test setup

### Error Patterns
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'debug')` - Logger import issues
- `expect(received).toBe(expected) // Expected: false, Received: true` - Loading state issues
- `Can't access .root on unmounted test renderer` - Component lifecycle issues
- `expect(received).toBeGreaterThan(expected) // Expected: > 0, Received: 0` - Performance metric issues

## Error Handling

### Logger Error Handling
- Provide fallback logger implementation for test environments
- Ensure logger methods are always available and callable
- Add proper error boundaries around logger usage

### Hook Error Handling
- Ensure all async operations have proper try-catch blocks
- Guarantee loading states are always updated, even on errors
- Provide fallback values for failed operations

### Test Error Handling
- Add proper cleanup for test renderers and hooks
- Ensure test isolation through proper mock reset
- Provide meaningful error messages for test failures

## Testing Strategy

### Fix Verification Approach
1. **Incremental Testing**: Fix issues in small batches and verify each fix
2. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure fixes don't break other tests
3. **Performance Validation**: Verify performance metrics work correctly
4. **Integration Testing**: Test that refactored components work together

### Test Categories to Address
1. **Logger Tests**: Verify logger works in all test environments
2. **Hook Tests**: Verify state management and async operations
3. **Component Tests**: Verify component lifecycle and memory management
4. **Integration Tests**: Verify refactored components work together
5. **Performance Tests**: Verify performance metrics and monitoring

### Success Criteria
- All 128 failing tests pass
- No new test failures introduced
- Test execution time remains reasonable
- Memory usage during tests stays within bounds
- All test categories maintain their intended coverage
