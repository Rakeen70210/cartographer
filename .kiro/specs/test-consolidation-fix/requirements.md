# Test Suite Consolidation and Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The Cartographer project has an extensive but problematic test suite with 44 failing test suites, 387 failed tests, and significant redundancy. This feature aims to consolidate redundant tests, fix critical test failures, and establish a maintainable testing strategy that ensures code quality while reducing maintenance overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Environment Stabilization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a stable test environment that runs consistently across different systems, so that I can trust test results and focus on feature development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the React Native testing environment SHALL initialize without module resolution errors
2. WHEN tests use React Native components THEN mocks SHALL properly simulate component behavior without throwing errors
3. WHEN tests use Expo modules THEN all required modules SHALL be properly mocked with consistent behavior
4. WHEN tests use third-party libraries THEN dependency mocks SHALL prevent version conflicts and runtime errors
5. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN the environment SHALL be deterministic and reproducible

### Requirement 2: Test Suite Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consolidated test suite without redundant tests, so that test execution is faster and maintenance is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple test files test the same functionality THEN they SHALL be merged into the most comprehensive existing test file OR deleted if too complex to merge
2. WHEN test files have overlapping test cases THEN duplicate tests SHALL be removed while preserving unique test scenarios
3. WHEN redundant test files exist THEN they SHALL be deleted after merging content into remaining files OR deleted entirely if consolidation is too complex
4. WHEN utility function tests are scattered THEN they SHALL be consolidated into existing test files by module OR removed if too fragmented
5. WHEN integration tests overlap with unit tests THEN duplicate tests SHALL be removed OR entire test files SHALL be deleted if overlap is too extensive

### Requirement 3: Critical Test Failure Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all critical test failures resolved or removed, so that the test suite provides reliable feedback on code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Native component tests fail due to mock issues THEN proper component mocks SHALL be implemented OR the tests SHALL be deleted if too complex to fix
2. WHEN hook tests fail due to renderer issues THEN testing library setup SHALL be corrected OR failing tests SHALL be removed if unfixable
3. WHEN geometry operation tests fail THEN Turf.js mocks SHALL return consistent, valid results OR overly complex tests SHALL be deleted
4. WHEN database tests fail THEN SQLite mocks SHALL simulate real database behavior accurately OR problematic tests SHALL be removed
5. WHEN async tests timeout consistently THEN proper async handling SHALL be implemented OR unreliable tests SHALL be deleted

### Requirement 4: Test Organization and Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized test structure using existing files, so that I can easily find and maintain tests without creating new files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are consolidated THEN they SHALL use existing test files and directory structure
2. WHEN redundant test files exist THEN they SHALL be merged into the most comprehensive existing file
3. WHEN test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be added to existing setup files in __tests__/setup/
4. WHEN test data is needed THEN it SHALL be added to existing mock files or factory functions
5. WHEN test categories exist THEN they SHALL be organized within existing directory structure

### Requirement 5: Performance Test Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests that run efficiently and provide meaningful metrics, so that I can identify performance regressions without slowing down development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (< 30 seconds per test)
2. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be consistent and comparable across test runs
3. WHEN performance tests fail THEN they SHALL provide actionable feedback about performance issues
4. WHEN large datasets are tested THEN tests SHALL use representative but manageable data sizes
5. WHEN performance tests run in CI THEN they SHALL account for system variability with appropriate tolerances

### Requirement 6: Mock Strategy Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized mocks across all tests, so that test behavior is predictable and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Native modules are mocked THEN they SHALL use consistent mock implementations across all tests
2. WHEN Expo modules are mocked THEN they SHALL simulate real module behavior accurately
3. WHEN third-party libraries are mocked THEN mocks SHALL be centralized and reusable
4. WHEN database operations are mocked THEN they SHALL maintain state consistency within test scenarios
5. WHEN network operations are mocked THEN they SHALL simulate both success and failure scenarios

### Requirement 7: Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage that focuses on critical functionality, so that I can be confident in code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core fog calculation logic is tested THEN coverage SHALL be >= 90% for critical paths
2. WHEN database operations are tested THEN all CRUD operations SHALL have comprehensive test coverage
3. WHEN React hooks are tested THEN all hook states and transitions SHALL be verified
4. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN both expected and unexpected errors SHALL be handled
5. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN boundary conditions and invalid inputs SHALL be covered

### Requirement 8: Test Execution Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast test execution that doesn't impede development workflow, so that I can run tests frequently during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete in under 5 minutes on standard development hardware OR slow tests SHALL be deleted
2. WHEN individual test files run THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds OR problematic tests SHALL be removed
3. WHEN tests are parallelized THEN they SHALL not have race conditions OR flaky tests SHALL be deleted
4. WHEN tests use timeouts THEN they SHALL be optimized for specific requirements OR timeout-prone tests SHALL be removed
5. WHEN tests clean up resources THEN they SHALL not leak memory OR resource-heavy tests SHALL be deleted

### Requirement 9: Test Maintenance and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-documented tests that are easy to maintain and extend, so that the test suite remains valuable as the codebase evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested
2. WHEN complex test scenarios exist THEN they SHALL include comments explaining the test logic
3. WHEN test utilities are created THEN they SHALL be documented with usage examples
4. WHEN test patterns are established THEN they SHALL be documented in testing guidelines
5. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL provide clear guidance on what went wrong

### Requirement 10: Continuous Integration Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that run reliably in CI/CD environments, so that automated testing provides trustworthy feedback on pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI THEN they SHALL have consistent results across different CI environments
2. WHEN tests use system resources THEN they SHALL be compatible with CI resource constraints
3. WHEN tests generate artifacts THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up after test completion
4. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN they SHALL provide sufficient information for remote debugging
5. WHEN tests run in parallel in CI THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
