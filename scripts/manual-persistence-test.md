# Manual Persistence Testing Guide

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Start Android Emulator**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

2. **Configure Location Simulation**
   - Open Android Emulator Extended Controls (⋯ button)
   - Go to Location tab
   - Set initial location: 37.7749, -122.4194 (San Francisco)

## Test Execution

### Test 1: Initial Data Creation (REQ 2.1)

**Objective**: Create initial revealed areas and verify they persist

**Steps**:
1. ✅ App starts successfully
2. ✅ Navigate to Map tab
3. ✅ Wait for location permission grant
4. ✅ Verify GPS location is acquired
5. ✅ Observe initial fog overlay covering the map
6. ✅ Move location in emulator to create revealed areas
7. ✅ Verify fog overlay has holes where you've been
8. ✅ Create 3-4 revealed areas by moving to different locations

**Expected Results**:
- Dark fog overlay initially covers entire map
- As you move, circular areas become revealed (no fog)
- Revealed areas persist as you continue moving
- New areas merge with existing ones when overlapping

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: Location tracking working, revealed areas being created and saved to database

### Test 2: App Restart Persistence (REQ 2.1, 2.4)

**Objective**: Verify revealed areas persist after app restart

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Note current revealed areas on map
2. ✅ Close app completely (not just background)
3. ✅ Restart app: `npx expo run:android`
4. ✅ Navigate to Map tab
5. ✅ Compare revealed areas with previous session

**Expected Results**:
- All previously revealed areas should be visible immediately
- No fog overlay in previously explored areas
- Exact same areas revealed as before restart

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: Database loading working correctly, revealed areas persist exactly

### Test 3: Viewport-Based Fog Calculation (REQ 2.2)

**Objective**: Test fog rendering across different viewports

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Start with existing revealed areas
2. ✅ Pan map to different areas
3. ✅ Zoom in and out at different levels
4. ✅ Verify fog updates correctly for each viewport
5. ✅ Check performance during viewport changes

**Expected Results**:
- Fog renders correctly in all viewports
- Revealed areas remain visible regardless of zoom/pan
- Smooth performance during map interaction
- No flickering or rendering issues

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: Viewport-based fog calculation working smoothly

### Test 4: New Area Merging (REQ 2.3)

**Objective**: Test merging of new areas with existing ones

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Start with existing revealed areas
2. ✅ Move to location adjacent to existing area
3. ✅ Verify new area merges with existing
4. ✅ Move to completely separate location
5. ✅ Verify separate area is created
6. ✅ Restart app and verify all areas persist

**Expected Results**:
- Adjacent areas merge seamlessly
- Separate areas remain distinct
- All areas persist after restart
- No gaps or overlaps in merged areas

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: Union operations working correctly, areas merge properly

### Test 5: Performance with Large Dataset (PERF_1, PERF_2)

**Objective**: Test performance with extensive revealed areas

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create 10+ revealed areas across map
2. ✅ Monitor app startup time
3. ✅ Test fog calculation performance
4. ✅ Check memory usage
5. ✅ Verify smooth viewport changes

**Expected Results**:
- App starts within reasonable time (<5 seconds)
- Fog calculations complete quickly (<1 second)
- No memory leaks or performance degradation
- Smooth user experience

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: Performance remains good with multiple revealed areas

### Test 6: Data Integrity (INT_1, INT_2)

**Objective**: Verify data integrity and error handling

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Check app logs for geometry validation
2. ✅ Verify no database errors
3. ✅ Test with complex overlapping areas
4. ✅ Monitor for any corruption issues

**Expected Results**:
- No geometry validation errors
- All polygons properly formed
- No database corruption
- Proper error handling

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: No errors observed, geometry validation working
